# Algorithms in Python

A collection of classic and advanced **Algorithms and Data Structures** implemented in Python.  
This repository was created as part of my **Algorithms and Data Structures** course and serves both as a study resource and a personal reference.

Each algorithm is written from scratch to demonstrate the core logic behind common computational techniques, data organization methods, and problem-solving paradigms.

## Contents

### Data Structures
- **AVL Tree** – a self-balancing binary search tree.
- **Binary Tree** – basic tree structure implementation.
- **Heap** – max/min heap with insertion and heapify operations.
- **Skip List** – probabilistic data structure for fast search, insertion, and deletion.
- **Unrolled Linked List** – optimized list structure storing multiple elements per node.
- **Queue** – simple FIFO queue implementation.
- **Hash Table** – associative array with hashing and collision handling.

### Algorithms
- **Bloom Filter** – probabilistic structure for fast membership testing (uses a hash-based Rabin–Karp setup).
- **Fulkerson Algorithm** – maximum flow in a flow network.
- **Jarvis March (Gift Wrapping)** – convex hull algorithm for computational geometry.
- **Pattern Search (Rabin–Karp)** – substring search using rolling hashes.
- **Prim’s Algorithm** – finding a minimum spanning tree in a weighted graph.
- **Shell Sort** – efficient generalization of insertion sort.
- **Suffix Array / Tree** – structure for fast substring and pattern queries.
- **Triangulation** – geometric algorithm for polygon triangulation.
- **Ullman’s Algorithm** – subgraph isomorphism detection.
- **Graph Coloring** – assign colors to graph nodes so that adjacent nodes differ.
- **Graph Algorithms (General)** – BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, and more.
